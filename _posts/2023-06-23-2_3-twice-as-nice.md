## challenge #2 - twice as nice üîÅ
<br/>
_This challenge is based on contracts from [Abracadabra.money](https://abracadabra.money)_

I just found out Cauldron V4 is vulnerable! I've revoked access to Degenbox and decided to transfer my WETH to Sushi's BentoBox while they figure this mess out. 

Objective: Drain the Alice's BentoBox WETH balance. 

[See the contracts](https://github.com/AshiqAmien/decently-safe-defi/tree/master/src/Contracts/twice-as-nice)
