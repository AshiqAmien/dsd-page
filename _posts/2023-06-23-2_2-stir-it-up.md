## challenge #3 - stir it up 🧑‍🍳
<br/>
_This challenge is based on contracts from [Abracadabra.money](https://abracadabra.money)_

We just fixed up Cauldron V4, everything should finally be safe! To get things back in action, we've deployed a WETH and DVT cauldron. To be extra safe, we also had our intern deploy a new version of DegenBox just to have a fresh start. 


Objective: Drain both WETH and DVT cauldrons of their collateral.


[See the contracts](https://github.com/AshiqAmien/decently-safe-defi/tree/master/src/Contracts/stir-it-up)
