## <b><u>Decently Safe DeFi</u></b> 
<br>
Decently Safe DeFi is a wargame to learn offensive security of DeFi smart contracts. The challenges are modelled after the excellent [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/), but instead of being based on theoretical vulnerabilities, the challenges are modelled after near-misses in the real world. By removing subtle security controls or reversing minor misconfigurations, we can learn about the critical vulnerabilities that was avoided in a protocol. 

Feel free to [submit PRs](https://github.com/AshiqAmien/decently-safe-defi) to include your challenges made from real-life near misses, or, [send me a DM](twitter.com/AshiqAmien) if you're part of a protocol and would like some challenges made! If you're just looking to get into the challenges, head to the [instructions](../20230623/1_instructions) to get started!
